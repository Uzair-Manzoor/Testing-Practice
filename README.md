## Function Descriptions

### stringLength(string)

This function takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters in the string. It also checks if the string is at least 1 character long and not longer than 10 characters. If these conditions are not met, the function throws errors.

### reverseString(string)

The `reverseString` function takes a string as an argument and returns the reversed version of the string.

### Calculator Class

The `Calculator` class provides basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each method takes two numbers as arguments and performs the corresponding operation. The `divide` method checks for division by zero and throws an error if encountered.

### capitalize(string)

The `capitalize` function takes a string as an argument and returns the same string with the first character capitalized. It throws an error if the input is not a string.
